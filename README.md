# 🚦 Smart AI-Based Traffic Management System 🚗

## Overview 🌍
The **Smart AI-Based Traffic Management System** is designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections using real-time monitoring and AI/ML-powered decision-making. The system dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on sensor data, improving traffic efficiency and reducing congestion. This project leverages the **MERN stack** for the backend and frontend, with **machine learning** models for real-time traffic prediction and optimization.

## Features 🔧
- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring** 📡: Collects data from IoT sensors, cameras, and traffic monitoring devices.
- **Dynamic Traffic Light Adjustment** 💡: AI-based algorithms that adjust traffic light timings based on live traffic data.
- **Web Dashboard** 🖥️: An interactive frontend built with React.js for real-time traffic monitoring and control.
- **AI/ML Integration** 🤖: Machine learning models for traffic prediction and optimization, improving traffic light decision-making.
- **Scalability** 📈: Easily expandable to support multiple intersections and cities with minimal setup.

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (MERN Stack)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI/ML**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- **IoT**: Raspberry Pi, Traffic Cameras, Motion Sensors
- **Deployment**: AWS, Heroku (or any cloud platform)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation 🛠️
